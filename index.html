                <p class="paragraph">“After 1970, we went on to win the title in 1994,” recalled Cafu. “We went 24 years
                    without winning
                    it, including in 1982 and 1986, when we played our very best football and still didn’t win. As a
                    result, everybody thought that if we couldn’t win in 82 and 86, then we weren’t going to win any
                    more trophies. "But no, that wasn’t true. We had to fight that mentality and we did it in 1994 by
                    playing a simple game with a clear objective.”</p>
